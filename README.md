# Library Management System

A simple console-based library management system implemented in C++ as a Data Structures course project.

## Features
- Add, remove, search, and display books
- Sort books by code or publication year
- Loan request management using **Queue** (Linked List implementation)
- Operation history using **Stack** (last 5 operations)
- Doubly Linked List for storing books

## Data Structures Used
- **Doubly Linked List** → for books (dynamic size, easy insertion/deletion)
- **Queue** (Linked List) → for loan requests (FIFO)
- **Stack** (Array-based) → for operation history (LIFO, limited to 5)

## How to Run
1. Compile: `g++ library.cpp -o library`
2. Run: `./library` (Linux/Mac) or `library.exe` (Windows)

## Report
See the attached report file for detailed explanation.
